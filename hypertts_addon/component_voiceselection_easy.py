# VoiceSelectionEasy is going to be used with ComponentEasy to provide simplified access to the
# voice list. It should inherit from VoiceSelection.
# it should only show the following filter combo boxes:
# - Language
# - Service
# it should also show the voice list in a combo box
# since it only allows selecting one voice, the mode should always default to single voice.
# no need to show the voice list (only required for random or priority modes)
# the VoiceSelectionEasy component doesn't need a scroll area since it will be simpler and more compact.
